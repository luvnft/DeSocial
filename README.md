## Overview

This project aims to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional centralized social media platforms. By leveraging blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks, we aim to empower users with control over their data and provide a platform for free expression.

## Features

- **Decentralization:** The platform operates on a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring no single point of control or failure.
  
- **Censorship Resistance:** Users have the freedom to express themselves without fear of centralized censorship. Content is stored and verified on the blockchain.

- **Data Ownership:** Users have control over their data and can choose how it is shared. No third party can access or control user information without their consent.

- **Token Economy:** The platform may implement a token-based economy to incentivize users and node operators. Users can be rewarded for contributing to the network, and tokens may be used for various platform activities.

- **Privacy:** Advanced encryption and privacy features to protect user data and communication.
